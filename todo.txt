1. Text "Call to Action 1!", "Call to Action 2!", and "Call to Action 3!" should look like default paragraph text, no underlines, different colors, etc.
2. Link with clickable text "link 2" should have "accent" color on page load, "highlight" color when visited, and gray text shadow when user hovers or clicks on it.
3. Headline text "Headline 4" should be centered and bold.
4. The first letter of paragraph that begins with "Lorem ipsum 1" should be twice as large as other paragraph text.
5. Submit button with text "Sign Up for Email List" should have rounded corners, background of "accent" color, and text color of white.
6. The article that starts with "Headline 3" should have a background of "highlight" color.


Remember, if you add a class for styling purposes, it should be reusable. For example, a class of "highlight-text" might be used for all text you'd like to style to have the "highlight" font color.
